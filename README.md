# Adventure Collective

Working together to build adventurous things.
{: .lead}

---

Our projects follow a couple of rules:

## 1. Be adventurous

It should be something that we haven't seen, or worked on before.

(This doesn't mean it should be difficult, just that we're doing something new.)

## 2. Be achievable

There should be a way of something being **done** - whether it's shared online, or shown to people in real life.

(This doesn't mean it has to end there; just that we have a target to work to.)
