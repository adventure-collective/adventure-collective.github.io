# Adventure Collective

Working together to build adventurous things.

---

Our projects have a few principles:

## 1/ Be adventurous

It should be something that we haven't seen, or worked on before.

(This doesn't mean it should be difficult, just that we're working on something new.)

## 2/ Be achievable

There should be a way of it being **done** - whether it's put online, or shown to people in real life.

(It doesn't have to finish there; we just need a target to work to.)

## 3/ Be open

Wherever possible - a project should be accessible and open for people to help.
