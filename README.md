# Adventure Collective

Working together to build adventurous things.

---

Our projects have a few principles:

## 1/ Be exploratory

By finding our way toward building something step by step, we're able to pick the best routes.

This doesn't mean having no plan, just that our plan doesn't constrain implementation.

## 2/ Be achievable

There should be a way of it being **done** - whether it's published & shared online, or shown to people in real life.

(It doesn't have to finish there; we just need a target to work to.)

## 3/ Be open

A project should be accessible and open for people to see progress & help out with.

We don't have to adventure on our own, or in secret.
